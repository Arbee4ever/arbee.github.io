*console.log("Hello World")*<br>
*Output:*<br>
*>>Hello World*<br/>
<br/>
Now I can finally  talk to you... Provided that there actually is a "you".<br>
<br>
Anyways, I now finally managed ot complete the first Version of my Blog Feature on my Website. I'll be posting stuff about my Projects, Projects my team is working on and other sutff. Mainly technical stuff though. The release of the blog Feature also marks the first milestone for my Website, now having its first Version finished aswell. I still have a lot of stuff in mind that I want to add to my Website, but I'll put the Development of this Site on pause for a bit now and focus on other Stuff. Like a Discord bot for my Game Development team. This is not completely guaranteed though. I may be adding a link to my Website from this Site soon, so all my posts automatically get sent into my [Discord](https://discord.gg/VfgHXtqSwz "Join my Discord Server with this link") and everyone can read them faster. Also I'll replace that image above with a proper, fitting image, as this one is just my Wordmark and doesn't really fit what I imagined for it. That's all I have to say for now though. See you again soon. Whether on Discord, Twitter or Reddit, I'm looking forward to chatting with some people.<br>

*Arbee over and out!*
