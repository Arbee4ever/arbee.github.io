*Hey... So uhm... This post apparently was written with a time Machine*<br>
<br>
Actually, I just used some trickery behind the scenes to make this appear at the date where I got my redesign from [ralf baenecke](https://www.instagram.com/ralfbaenecke/ "View his Instagram by clicking this!"). This post is just as a reminder that there was *a time before* where I had an old look which was made by me in a few minutes. It definitely didn't look *good*. I'd even say it looked **bad**. But now I don't have to worry about a **bad** design because I now got the new *good* Design all over my Social Media which actually looks *good*.<br>
<br>
*Arbee over and out!*
