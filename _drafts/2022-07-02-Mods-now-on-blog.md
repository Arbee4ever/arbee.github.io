I finally managed to completely add support for Minecraft mods to my Blog. From now on, every mod and mod update that I publish on [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com "Checkout modrinth!") will be linked here as well.
<br>
This is to make it easier for everyone to discover and play my mods.
<br>
Also, I made it possible to filter for Categories, so you can easily find all posts in the Category ["MINECRAFT MOD"](https://arbeeco.de/blog?c=MINECRAFT%20MOD) by clicking on the category anywhere you can find it.
<br>
Lastly I rewrote the site with [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev) to make it build faster when I make changes to it.
<br>
In the future I'll also be improving the download link and adding an advanced filter to the main [Blog page](https://arbeeco.de/blog), if I can figure out how to properly do it of course.<br>
<br>
*Arbee over and out!*
